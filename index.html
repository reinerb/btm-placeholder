        B'nai Torah MetroWest invites you to join us as we embark on a new journey together!
      </p>
      <p>
        Affectionately known as “BTM,” we are a Reformed, pluralistic, inclusive, community located in the Western
        suburbs of Boston.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the heart of who we are is a deep commitment to social action and a hope to build a community partnership
        that will let each of us take responsibility for our own Judaism in a way that feels right.
      </p>
